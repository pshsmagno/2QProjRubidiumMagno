      <h1>Water-related problems</h1>
      <h2>Droughts</h2>
       <p>If an area receives little rain for long periods of time, it can cause droughts. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines drought as the following: 
          1: a period of dryness especially when prolonged. Coming from this dictionary definition, a drought is basically a time period on a given area or 
          location that experiences below average or normal precipitation. This lack of normal or sufficient precipitation in the form of either rain or snow 
          can cause a reduction of groundwater and moisture in the soil, damage to crops, reduced flow in streams, rivers, and lakes which then results to an 
          overall water shortage. It is a costly weather event accounting for the second most costly after hurricanes. A drought may happen as short as a few weeks
          to as long as a few years, with some  regions experiencing drought to as long as a decade. And the longer a drought lasts, the harmful effects are more 
          evident on the people. It can affect their access to clean drinking water. Droughts affect crops also. It follows that as droughts persists in a certain 
          area, crop livelihood and production can be severely affected.</p>

       <h2> Water Scarcity</h2>
       <p>According to UN-Water (n.d.), “Water scarcity can mean scarcity in availability due to physical shortage, or scarcity in access due to the failure
       of institutions to ensure a regular supply or due to a lack of adequate infrastructure.” Water Scarcity has an impact on the entire world. More and more
         regions are reaching the limit of sustainable access to water services. </p>

     <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
      <p>Water pollution occurs when contaminants such as chemicals or microorganisms are introduced to water bodies 
         or water sources such as streams, lakes, rivers , aquifers and oceans, making it unsafe for humans or the environment.
         Much of the problem comes from our wastewater being dumped into this water bodies, which is estimated to go as high as 80% untreated water.
         Contaminants can also come from other sources. Chemicals from fertilizers , pesticides used in agricultural products, chemicals from factories are 
        also carried into these water bodies thereby polluting them. Plastic production during the last half of the century is also a big contributory factor  
        in the pollution of waterways. Other sources may come from oil spills and oil drips from the automotive industry as well as radioactive sources.</p>
