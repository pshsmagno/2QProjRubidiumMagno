     <h2> What is Water?</h2>
        <p> Water is a substance that is composed of Hydrogen and Oxygen.
            It is tasteless, colorless, and odorless in its natural form. It can exist in 3 phases, solid, liquid, and gas. 
            Its boiling point is at 100 °C while its melting point is at 0 °C. It’s a very essential substance as many systems on Earth depend on it.</p>
     
        <p>Water occurs as a liquid under normal conditions. Vast amounts of water are found on the surface of the earth. They gather in bodies. 
         Examples of bodies of water are lakes, rivers, oceans, springs, etc. A myriad of plants and animals live in these bodies of water.</p>

        <p>Water can also go through cycles. The water cycle is when water is changed from liquid to gas which allows it to be transported through 
         the atmosphere and condenses into clouds. As clouds get heavier, the water from the clouds start to fall as rain (or in colder conditions, as hail or snow). 
         This water that falls can nourish plant and animal life and fills lakes, rivers, and streams inland. The water in inland bodies then flow back into the sea 
         and the cycle repeats.</p>
 
        <p>Because of its abundance, water has played a major role in human society and humans themselves (as 60% of our body is composed of water). 
        Water is an important part in our cultures as humans and many animals need it for drinking. Humans also use water for agriculture, transportation, 
        energy and many more. But how are they used for these purposes? Water is used to irrigate crops as plants need it for growing. Bodies of water have been 
        used for transportation since ancient times as boats sail on them. Water can be used for energy like in hydroelectric dams where electricity is generated
        from the water flowing through turbines in the dam. Water is also used for recreation and sanitation like swimming, cleaning, and bathing. Water has so 
        many more uses.</p>
