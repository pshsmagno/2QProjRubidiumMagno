      <h2>Characteristics of Water</h2>

      <p>Water molecules have 2 hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, which is why its formula is H<sub>2</sub>O. It has a molar 
        mass of 18.0151 grams per mole. It’s melting point is 0 degrees Celsius and a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius </p>

      <h2>Water and Human Civilization</h2>

      <p>Water is not just important only for the biological aspects of humans. It has played a major role in societies, cultures, and civilizations. 
       Water took a center-stage in many ancient cultures. Neptune who was the god of the sea was one of the most powerful gods in Greek mythology. 
       The Ganges River in India was regarded as sacred from 3,000 year old historical accounts. In Egypt, the Nile River was the lifeblood of the kingdom 
       as it was its political and economic center. Societies’ respect for water grew as they needed it very much. </p>

       <p>Ancient cities were built beside bodies of water since these bodies were important for transportation, trade, agriculture and irrigation, 
        and sources of water. Ancient cities that were built beside seas had maritime-based economies. Trading also played a major role in ancient civilizations.
         Bodies of water played a major part in facilitating this trade.</p>

       <p>Most people from ancient times relied on fresh water bodies as sources of water. However, these bodies of water were also used for disposing sewage and 
        trash. Towns were abandoned when water sources became too polluted. Prosperous ancient cities found new ways to provide clean water to their citizens.</p>

      <p>Today, technology has advanced which has made water collection and treatment easier. Still, many problems about water still remain. </p>
